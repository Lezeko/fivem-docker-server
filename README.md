# FiveM Docker Server with MariaDB ü¶∫

This image provides a FiveM/txAdmin server and database for qbcore/esx. After the first startup, it downloads the defined version from the CFX servers. If there is an update to the server files, simply recreate the container without having to redownload the image again. Everything will be downloaded again (only new) and you can continue.

        image: fivem-server
        restart: unless-stopped

```
Please replace all things needed.

4. Start docker container
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. After all data has been downloaded, mariadb and txAdmin server will start.

6. Now the txAdmin server must be set up. This is done via the web interface provided by FiveM.<br>
   [[Here]](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server-txadmin/#start-the-server) you can read from point 2 on, how to set up txAdmin. (The PIN can be found in the server console)

7. After that the FiveM server will be started and you can play.
